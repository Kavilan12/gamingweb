<h3 className="text-danger">A game that has many games</h3>
<p>Roblox is an online platform and storefront where users go to play games. Roblox is not a game, it is a place where people play games made by other developers. In this sense, it is more similar to PC platform Steam than it is to any online children’s game.

What makes Roblox different from anything else in the games industry — including a storefront like Steam — is that all the games are made by its users. On Roblox, the fun doesn’t just come from playing games, it also comes from making games. These games are not formally developed by Roblox Corporation, but by users of the platform. Currently, the official website boasts that its users have published over 20 million games on the platform.You can watch the tutorial video to know more about roblox.</p>

    <p>“Roblox is a very nice and good game. The one point why I put 3 stars is because it can be very addicting to some kids. Normally, if a child had to study in Science in a normal school day, they will find it hard. After their teacher marking, they will get over for example 9/25 because of playing. (This has happened to my child once.) So kids, teens, and parents. Whatever you do, don't play or watch Roblox when there is a study you have to do. First, quit Roblox. After studying, you can play. Enjoy!”</p>
    <h2>Jay Jay</h2>

    <p>“Definitely a good game. It’s educational in a subtle way, it’s engaging and entertaining. Even adults play it. There is a whole world of games for kids to explore. However, some games are a tad violent. Certain games may also include blood. But overall, a little bit of cartoon violence or blood never hurt a child. Parents should also keep in mind that this is an online platform. Make it clear to your children to never give personal information to ANYONE on the internet such as your real name, phone number, where you live or where you go to school. Besides that, it’s fine for kids to socialize on the internet. But be aware that there are some players that will often T-bag or call other players “Trash” or “Noob” The chat filter is pretty reliable and if someone is ever picking on you, you can just block and report them. Overall, very fun and engaging game."</p>

    <p>“This game seems pretty bad for children, but if you teach them that the stuff in the game is bad there is a high probability that they won’t do it in the real world, and if you sometimes play the game with your kid you can feel how they will act and you can learn what your kid is playing.”</p>
