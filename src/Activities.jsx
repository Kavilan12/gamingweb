                    <h4>What is a community manager?</h4>

                    <p>A community manager acts as the liaison between an organization and its audience. They act as the voice, tone, and moderator of the brand through community support, content distribution, and digital engagement to build brand presence and trust, both online and in-person.</p>

                    <h4>How to become a community manager?</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Community managers come from a variety of backgrounds -- anything from recruiting to journalism to engineering -- because being successful in the role relies more on a set of skills than a degree.

First, it's important for community managers to be knowledgeable about and across the business. Community managers should be able to rely on their experience with their organization to confidently address their audience or tap into internal resources to appropriately handle any issues that may arise. Beyond a working understanding of the business, managers need to build productive, professional relationships both internally and externally in order to be a more authentic and reliable brand ambassador.</p>

                    <p>1.Earn a bachelor’s degree. Community managers usually need a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field such as marketing or communications</p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>2.Gain experience with marketing, sales or social media. Employers look for community managers who are familiar with marketing strategies, sales techniques and social media management. Any relevant job experience in these areas is valuable to this role.</p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>3.Demonstrate communications skills. Writing blogs, drafting social media posts and planning email campaigns are all essential in the role of community manager. Demonstrate your ability by maintaining your own active social accounts, guest blogging or doing freelance writing.</p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>Build a strong resume. Craft a resume that emphasizes your experience building community and refining branding. You can gain this in other jobs or as a volunteer working on marketing campaigns for nonprofit organizations.</p>

                    <h1>QA Tester</h1>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>San Fransisco,CA</h3>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h4>What is QA Tester?</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <p>A quality assurance tester, or QA tester, works to establish and maintain standards in various professional fields, like software production, video games, digital products, web platforms and communication networks. They are also in charge of finding flaws, tracing error sources and problem-solving independently and in QA teams. In this capacity, they also work closely with developers to improve the functionality, effectiveness and productivity of the workplace as well as the quality of the product.

Quality assurance testing is sometimes confused with quality control testing, but the two differ significantly. Quality control refers to the process of detecting flaws in products that have already been manufactured and services delivered to customers. In comparison, quality assurance involves the internal developmental process of products and services before they are released to the public.</p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h4>How to become a QA Tester?</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <p>1. Enroll in college
Consider the qualifications required for the industry you'd like to work in to figure out which type of degree or certification you need to earn. Most software quality assurance tester positions require a minimum of an associate degree and recommend a bachelor's degree to be a competitive candidate. Research the accredited institutions near you that offer the qualifications you need. Many provide statistics on their graduation rates and employment rates after graduation that can help you decide where to enroll.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>2. Complete your education
It's important to choose a good major if you want to become a QA tester. Consider which industry you want to work in, and choose a relevant major from that field. For example, if you want to work as a software tester, consider getting a bachelor's degree in computer science, engineering or math.

While you're in school, keep in mind that this is an excellent opportunity to network and earn qualifications. Networking with your classmates and instructors is important for future employment and collaboration opportunities.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>3. Consider an internship
An internship is a program used to give students and new graduates professional learning experience with employers in their field. Some positions may be paid, while others are unpaid, and they can last anywhere from a few months to a year. Internships are a good opportunity for new QA testers to build their resumes and try out their skills in a given industry.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>4. Apply for jobs
After meeting all educational requirements and gaining some experience, you can apply for open quality assurance testing positions. Look for job openings in an industry that interests you and matches your qualifications. Craft your resume and cover letter with the job description for each position in mind to make them feel personalized. To find openings and professional recommendations, make sure to interact with your professional network. If you receive multiple job offers, you can narrow them down based on where you want to live and what each employer offers in regard to salary and benefits.</p>

                    <h1>Game Designer</h1>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h3>San Fransisco,CA</h3>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <h4>What is Game Designer?</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <p>A game designer is someone who conceptualizes game plots and storylines, levels and environments, character interactions, and other creative aspects. It’s their job to work with other specialists - like developers, artists, and others - to communicate ideas and then project manage those ideas through to game production. 

Depending on the situation, game designers can specialize in a particular game element, and can work among a team of others for a commercial or independent game development company. They can even work on their own, conceiving, creating, programming, and publishing their own titles.  </p>
                   <br/>
                   <h4>How to become a game designer?</h4>
                   <br/>
                   <p>1. Get a degree. The video gaming industry is highly competitive. While there are no formal education requirements, completing a game design degree program can give you a competitive edge. Some game designer jobs may require a bachelor’s degree in computer programming or fine art, while others may only require a high school diploma. While talent is essential to game developers, knowledge and work experience in a related field like graphic design or computer science can help make you more of an asset. If school is not an option, there are various independent game design programs you can complete to boost your knowledge and experience.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>2. Decide your career path. Since video game design can be a broad field encompassing many roles, you’ll need to choose an area of focus. Do you want to be an environment artist in charge of backgrounds and scenery details? Or do you want to conceptualize the initial look of the game? Having an area of focus can ease the pressure of your job search, allowing you to hone in on the role you want, and avoid applying to roles outside of your dream position.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>3. Know more than the basics. The games industry is a high-pressure and deadline-driven environment, so you should have a full understanding of the game design process, from concept to publishing. A clear understanding of the designer’s roles and responsibilities can make you a stronger candidate for potential employers.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>4. Expand your skillset. Game designers need strong communication skills and consistent, meticulous attention to detail. Familiarize yourself with game engines, design software, programming languages, scripting languages, as well as the game publishing process, so that potential employers see you as a valuable and necessary asset.</p>
                   <br/>
                   <p>5. Search for positions. Create a website or create a profile on job sites to advertise your skills and availability. Try to network with people who work at indie companies or small game studios to get on their radar so that when an employment opportunity opens up, you are in the best position to get the job.</p>
                   <p>6. Design your own game. The best way to become a game designer is to design your own game. If you have the time and proper software, you should create a game or prototype that demonstrates your abilities and technical skills. If you don’t have access to the right resources, compile a resume and sample portfolio. When drafting your resume, outline any relevant design experience. If you don’t have any design experience, make sure your portfolio includes level samples that you designed to showcase your talent.</p>
